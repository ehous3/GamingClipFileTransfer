This allows you to transfer clips from your pc to your google drive to access on your phone. 

Input needed: You need to put in your path to the folder that houses your clips and also your gauth id.

Note: The todaysDate and filename may change based on the name of the file as it saves on your computer because the code is just grabbing the last 23 characters for date and 
60 for the filename. I have it set like this because that's what I need for my files.
